I have more of a passion for the games industry and any animation related to the games, but also never get scared of working in after effects for any other projects. Animation ignites me and gives me the opportunity to turn my ideas into reality, and that's why I'm here. I work in programs like spine 2d and After Effects. The tasks I perform are : -Character animation -Vfx; -2.5d animation -UI animation -Background animation etc. I have gone through various courses at different animation schools and am constantly improving my skills by freelancing for various clients. But I am also interested in developing and contributing to teamwork. I'm ready to be part of cool and interesting projects and make them better and more interesting."
